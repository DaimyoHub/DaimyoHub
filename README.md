### About me

I am pursuing the Parisian Master of Research in Computer Science (MPRI) at the Institut Polytechnique de Paris, with a focus on theoretical computer science—especially the interplay between programming languages and algebra through the Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence, which reveals profound links between logic, computation, and mathematical structure.
