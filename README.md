### About me

I am pursuing the Parisian Master of Research in Computer Science (MPRI) at the Institut Polytechnique de Paris. My main interests revolve around theoretical computer science, particularly the connections between programming languages and algebra. I am especially drawn to the Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence, which I see as a powerful lens for understanding the deep relationships between logic, computation, and mathematical structures.
